    <ol>
        <li>The number of Entries displayed on the "Protection" tab. This has no effect on blocking. <em>Default: 12</em></li>
        <li>Whether or not "allowed" connections are displayed on the "Protection" tab. This has no effect on blocking. Enabling this will decrease performance. It is recommended that this is left unchecked. <em>Default: Unchecked</em></li>
        <li>Whether or not to display color coded log window on the "Protection" tab. Enabling this may make it easier to read the log window. <em>Default: Checked</em></li>
        <li>If "Color code log window" (3) is enabled, this is where you can set your preferred colors to display in the log window on the "Protection" tab. "Blocked HTTP" are packets that are blocked on either port 80 or 443, which are commonly used to browse websites. Click on the colors to change them.</li>
        <li>This drop down menu gives options on what information is logged in a long term "History". It does not affect blocking, only the information that is recorded. If you do not plan on checking your history, then set this to "Log None". <em>Default: Log Allowed &amp; Blocked</em></li>
        <li>This drop down menu allows you to automatically clean up old logging history on a certain interval, set in days. You can choose to leave old history alone ("Do Nothing"), delete old history ("Remove"), or remove the data from PeerBlock, but store it elsewhere ("Archive &amp; Remove"). The archive location is set in "Archive to:" (7). <em>Default: Do Nothing</em></li>
        <li>The location the archive (set in number 6) is to be stored. You can select "Browse" if you want to choose a specific location to store these; otherwise leave this as the default. Default : "archives\" (without quotes)</li>
        <li>PeerBlock can notify you when it blocks a connection. When set to "HTTP Blocks", it will only notify you when it blocks a HTTP connection, which are typically used to view websites. This can be used to notify you that PeerBlock has blocked a website you are viewing, so you can decide to allow HTTP or view another webpage. <em>Default: Checked, HTTP Blocks</em></li>
        <li>When PeerBlock notifies you of blocking a connection (based on setting 8 above), having this checked will make the System Tray icon (typically near your clock) flash, to draw attention to it. <em>Default: Checked</em></li>
        <li>Saves your settings, so they can be used the next time you use PeerBlock. Click this button before exiting the settings screen. Perrblock will also save your settings when it exits</li>
        <li>There are two settings pages; these buttons will switch between them.</li>

        <li>This allows you to automatically start PeerBlock with Microsoft Windows. If P2P programs are also set to start with windows, this can help increase security. There 
            are however some problems using this method on Windows Vista\Windows 7 with UAC (User Account Control) enabled; see <a href="#"><!-- edit link please! -->Start with windows</a> for more information. <em>Default: Unchecked</em></li>
        <li>Selecting this makes PeerBlock open directly to the system tray, without showing any messages. This can be used if you set PeerBlock to start with windows (option 12). <em>Default: Unchecked</em></li>
        <li>This option allows you to choose whether to display a "Splash Screen" when PeerBlock starts. The splash screen displays the PeerBlock logo before it starts up, and is used so that you can be sure PeerBlock is loading. <em>Default: Checked</em></li>
        <li>Enabling this option will set PeerBlock to automatically check for updates. If there is an update available, it will prompt you go visit the webiste to download the newest version. It is recommended to use the newest version of PeerBlock, so this should be left checked. Note that PeerBlock will update the the newest version of the type of release you are using; for example, it you are using the "Public Release", PeerBlock will only update to new public releases. <em>Default: Checked</em></li>
        <li>Whether to check for new list updates. It is strongly recommended you leave this option checked, as this will automatically update each list to the newest version available. <em>Default: Checked</em></li>
        <li>How often to automatically check for updates. This includes both PeerBlock updates and list updates, if they are selected (settings 15 and 16). The more frequently PeerBlock is updated, the better the protection, however this also increases bandwidth (downloads). <em>Default: 2</em></li>
        <li>If you wish to use a proxy server, enter it here. Do not select this option if you do not use a proxy server, as updates will fail. Note that at this time, PeerBlock does not support proxies that require a username or password. <em>Default: Unchecked</em></li>
        <li>This option allows you to automatically close the updates windows after a period of time. This can be used to update PeerBlock on Windows startup, but have the update window hide. <em>Default: Checked, 10</em></li>
        <li>This will automatically update PeerBlock when you open it. It is strongly recommended that this be checked. Note that due to an unresolved bug, this option cannot be unchecked. <em>Default: Checked</em></li>
        <li>If checked, this hides the System Tray icon (typically near the clock). It can be used to reduce screen clutter. <em>Default: Unchecked</em></li>
        <li>This makes PeerBlock show only in the System Tray (typically near the clock) when it is closed. This reduces the number of programs that you need to keep track of, but allows PeerBlock to continue running. Note that to completely close PeerBlock with this option checked, you must right click the System Tray icon and select "Exit". <em>Default: Checked</em></li>
        <li>With this option checked, PeerBlock will always stay on top of other windows on your screen so that you can continuously monitor it. <em>Default: Unchecked</em></li>

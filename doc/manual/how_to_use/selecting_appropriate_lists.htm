        Selecting Appropriate Lists</h1>
    <p>
        One of the most important factors to consider when using PeerBlock is the selection
        of appropriate lists. But how do you know which lists to use? This documentation
        will help you understand which lists are appropriate for you to use with PeerBlock.
        This document does not cover how to use lists, only knowing which lists to use.
        For information on how to use lists, see <a href="#">
            <!--Using Lists-->
            Using Lists</a>.</p>
    <p>
        It is important to know where to find lists, and the quality of these lists. One
        popular source of lists is <a href="http://iblocklist.com">iblocklist.com</a>.<br />
        <a href="..\images\iblocklist-home.png">

    <p>
        After looking around <a href="http://iblocklist.com">iblocklist.com</a>, it is clear
        that there are many lists for many different purposes.</p>
    <p>
        In deciding which lists to use, you first need to know what <strong>you</strong>
        want to use the list for. For example, would you like more protection when using
        P2P software, or would you like more protection from your government? Once you know
        yourself what you need a list for, you can start looking for a list that fits your
        needs. Many such lists can be found on <a href="http://iblocklist.com">iblocklist.com</a>.
        On <a href="http://iblocklist.com">iblocklist.com</a>, click "Lists" (as pictured
        above), and then the "List Name" to view the details of lists. Once you have found
        a list that&#39;s description fits your needs, you need to know the quality of this
        list.</p>
    <p>
        There are many subjective indicators of quality, and as such there is no 'one-size-fits-all'
        test. Factors that need to be considered include the number of IP addresses and
        ranges in the list; more does not necessarily mean better. Take into account any
        user opinions of lists, such as those posted on <a href="http://iblocklist.com">iblocklist.com</a>
        or the <a href="http://forums.peerblock.com">PeerBlock Forums</a>, and feel free
        to ask any questions you might have about the list on either website (the PeerBlock
        forums are typically more active and might provide more information.).</p>
    <p>
        The most important factor however is the author of the lists. Just as you would
        not necessarily trust an unknown author of a book, unknown list authors are typically
        harder to trust to keep their lists up-to-date and correct. Some well-known list
        authors include <a href="http://blocklistpro.com">Bluetack (also known as "B.I.S.S")</a>,
        <a href="http://tbg.iblocklist.com/">TBG</a> and <a href="http://iblocklist.com">I-Blocklist</a>.
        All of these lists are available for free from <a href="http://iblocklist.com">iblocklist.com</a>.</p>

            Be careful using too many block lists, as blocking too many IP addresses can seriously
            degrade your internet exerience. For example, blocking too many IPs may reduce the
            number of total peers in P2P software (slowing your downloads), may stop you from
            browsing many corporatation's websites, or hamper online gaming.</p>
    <p>
        Clearly, selecting lists is a very fine balance! Once you have decided on which
        lists you wish to use in PeerBlock, see <a href="#">

    <p>
        If you would like any help selecting lists that suit you, feel free to create a
        thread on the <a href="http://forums.peerblock.com">PeerBlock Forums</a>, questions
        are typically answered very fast. When taking adive from people regarding lists,
        be sure to remember that people's needs differ, and as such what works for one person
        may not be the best setup for you.</p>

        Note that PeerBlock does <em>not</em> author any lists, and as such does not guarantee
        the accuracy or protction provided by them. The lists included are very popular
        lists, and are trusted by many people. For your reference, the default PeerBlock
        lists are:</p>

This describe ways to interface external applications with PG2.  It may provide
documentation for creating plugins later on.

Hide/Unhide PG2
-------------------------------
If you would like to bring PG2 out of the tray or send it back, you can do:

UINT msg=RegisterWindowMessage(_T("PeerGuardian2SetVisible"));
SendMessage(HWND_BROADCAST, msg, 0, TRUE); // TRUE to show, FALSE to hide.

Force PG2 to reload its lists
-------------------------------
As of beta 6, PeerGuardian 2 allows external list editors to force a list
reload and possibly cache regeneration.  This can be done like so:

UINT msg=RegisterWindowMessage(_T("PeerGuardian2LoadLists"));
SendMessage(HWND_BROADCAST, msg, 0, 0);

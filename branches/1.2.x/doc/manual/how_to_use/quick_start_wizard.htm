    <h1>PeerBlock Quick Start Wizard</h1>
    <p>
        When PeerBlock opens for the first time, the "PeerBlock Startup Wizard" will appear.
        This wizard will help you choose some of the standard settings to make PeerBlock
        work most effectively for you!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To continue with the Startup Wizard, click "Next"
            <br/>
            <a href="../images/startup-wizard-1.png">
                <img src="../images/startup-wizard-1-small.png" border="0" alt="startup-wizard-1-small"/>
                <br/>
                <small>Click to see full size</small></a>
        </li>
        <li>This window gives you two options regarding block/allow lists. These options are:
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
                <li>Which standard lists you wish to use, with a brief description. For more details
                    on which lists to choose, see <a href="../FAQ/index.htm#4">Which lists should I use?</a>.
                    If you wish to add more lists, select "Import\Create Lists". The next step (which
                    is identical to "List Manager", see <a href="#">List Manager</a>) will allow you
                    to do this, however it is not shown here. For standard use, the default options(<em>"P2P"
                        checked only</em>) are sufficient.
                </li>
                <li>This option will allow connections on "Port 80" and "Port 443", which are standard
                    ports used to browse the web. Whilst this will allow you to browse the entire web
                    without interuption, "bad" connections can also go through these ports. To increase
                    safety, it is recommended to leave this unchecked, and manually add websites of
                    interest later if there are any issues viewing particular websites.
                </li>
            </ol>
            Once you have finished, click "Next" to continue.

            </a>
        </li>
        <li>This window also has two options, this time regarding updates. The options are:
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha" start="3">
                <li>The frequency of list updates. The more frequently they are updated, the better
                    the protection, however increasing the update frequency also increases the bandwidth
                    (download) usage. Typically, the default option (<em>"Every other day"</em>) will
                    suit most users.
                </li>
                <li>Which updates will be checked automatically. If you select "PeerBlock", it will
                    check for an updated version, and if found will prompt you to visit the website
                    to update to the newest version. Choosing to update "Lists" will keep your block
                    lists more accurate, and increasde protection. It is recommended that "PeerBlock"
                    be checked, and <strong>strongly</strong> recommeneded that automatic list updates are checked.
                </li>
            </ol>
            Click "Next" when you have finished.

        <a name="1" style="font-weight: bold">What IS PeerBlock?</a>
        <p>
            The short version is: PeerBlock blocks "known bad" computers from accessing yours,
            and vice versa. Depending on the lists you have it setup to use, you can block governments,
            corporations, machines flagged for anti-p2p activites, even entire countries! Whether
            you're sharing files with Bittorrent or just surfing the web, PeerBlock can help
            protect you from the bad guys.
        </p>

        <a name="2" style="font-weight: bold">How does it do that?</a>
        <p>
            An IP Address is like a telephone number, or a street address, for your computer
            - any time you connect to the Internet, your IP address is used to make that connection.
            If you go to "www.google.com", your computer first translates this to an IP address
            (e.g. 66.102.1.104), then sends a request to that address for a web-page; when the
            www.google.com computer receives this message, part of it contains your computer's
            IP address so that it knows how to send the web-page back to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            PeerBlock is a type of program known as an "IP Filter". It lives way down deep inside
            the networking code on your computer - the stuff in Windows that actually makes/receives
            network connections for you - and inspects everything that flows past it. It looks
            at the IP address this network "packet" is coming from, and compares is against
            a list of "bad" ip-addresses; if it finds a match, it doesn't let that network packet
            make it through to the rest of your computer. If also looks at the IP address your
            network packets are going to, and does the same thing.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a name="3" style="font-weight: bold">Where does it get these lists?</a>
        <p>
            PeerBlock has a few default lists included, lists that are updated often so that
            they always contain the most up-to-date information. You can also specify other
            lists, for example many people enjoy using the lists provided by <a href="http://www.iblocklist.com">
            iblocklist.com</a>. And you can create your own lists, either "known safe" ip
            addresses like websites you trust, your company's servers, or gaming servers to
            which you need to connect; or your own "bad" lists of people you want to block.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a name="4" style="font-weight: bold">What lists should I use?</a>
        <p>
            That depends on what you want to do with PeerBlock! Do you want to block Ads? Use
            the built-in "Ads" list. Are you in college and want to protect your doings from
            the campus Network Police? Use the built-in "Edu" list. Many more blocklists are
            available, we recommend those available at iblocklist.com.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a name="5" style="font-weight: bold">Does this mean my P2P downloading is completely safe now?</a>
        <p>
            Not necessarily. While many people do use IP Filtering software like PeerBlock to
            help "protect" themselves from being sued for copyright infringement, it is not
            100% protection. In fact some people believe that using blocklists like this are
            completely useless. Others disagree, and believe that even if it's not 100% safe,
            it still lets them download files more safely. Sometimes they invoke the "Bear Principle":
            when running away from an angry bear you don't need to be faster than that bear
            . . . you only need to be faster than the guy next to you. However, as I seem to
            remember seeing on the old Peer Guardian site at one point:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The only way to be "safe" with P2P downloading is to not share copyrighted content!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            PeerBlock is good at what it does - keeping your computer from "talking" with ip
            addresses on your configured blocklists. Everything else is up to those blocklists
            themselves. And heck, even if the blocklists provided 100% coverage of "bad" ip-addresses,
            and if blocklists were 100% proven to work, there could still be some bugs in the
            PeerBlock software that may prevent it from working correctly on your machine; we
            offer no guarantees that it works, and disclaim any and all responsibility for the
            consequences of your own actions online. If you're sharing copyrighted music/video
            files and get sued by the relevant organizations, it's not our fault. If you're
            stuck in a country with an oppressive government and are trying to get out your
            plans regarding the upcoming revolution, and those in power break down your door
            and haul you away, it's not our fault. If you're sharing some secret footage of
            Area 51 and the "Men in Black" come knocking on your door, it's not our fault!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to download copyrighted material from the Internet, be aware that
            you may be breaking the law.
        </p>

        <a name="6" style="font-weight: bold">What is PeerBlock's relationship with the
        old PeerGuardian program?</a>
        <p>
            PeerBlock is actually based on the same code used to create PeerGuardian - specifically,
            the "PG2 RC1 Test3" Vista beta version. That code had a LOT of bugs in it, and hadn't
            been updated for about two years. So I started up this PeerBlock project to fix
            all those things that'd been annoying me for so long. A bunch of other people decided
            to pitch in and help out, some with development, some with testing, and now we're
            where we are today.
        </p>
        <p>
            So compared with old PeerGuardian software, PeerBlock is much more stable, doesn't
            require nearly so many hacks/workarounds to get working on Vista/Win7, and is actually
            under active development . . . so we can (and will!) actually respond to new bug
            reports or feature requests.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a name="7" style="font-weight: bold">Can I run PG2 and PeerBlock at the same time?</a>
        <p>
            No! As PeerBlock and PG2 both operate the same way, and in fact share a lot of code,
            they could conflict with one another and cause all sorts of strange behavior (including
            Windows crashes). In fact the two programs should not allow themselves to run at
            the same time, to protect you from these sorts of potential problems.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a name="8" style="font-weight: bold">Is there any reason to leave PG2 installed
        on my system?</a>
        <p>
            Only for nostalgia's sake. After you have PeerBlock running well on your system,
            there really is no point to leaving PG2 installed. Just note that you'll need to
            close PeerBlock before uninstalling PG2, due to some stuff we had to put in there
            to prevent PG2 from trying to run at the same time as PeerBlock.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a name="9" style="font-weight: bold">Which version should I run?</a>
        <p>
            We make two different types of PeerBlock releases available for you to download.
            Public Releases are released on our main www.peerblock.com website, and are generally
            considered to be the most stable; these are generally denoted by a version number
            like "0.9.2" or "1.0.0". Interim Releases are released on our devblog.peerblock.com
            "Development Blog", are released more frequently, and contain new bugfixes and/or
            features that have not yet received enough airtime to be considered stable enough
            for inclusion in a Public Release; these are generally named something like "PeerBlock
            Interim Release r131".
        </p>
        <p>
            Public Releases are recommended for most users. If you want to help test the "bleeding
            edge" of PeerBlock development, or if you have encountered a bug in the most recent
            Public Release that may be fixed in the Interim Release train, you should consider
            running an Interim Release.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just be aware that PeerBlock will check for new versions of whichever version you're
            currently running. If you're running a Public Release, PeerBlock will check for
            new Public Release versions and direct you to the main www.peerblock.com site to
            download it if one is detected. If you're running an Interim Release, PeerBlock
            will check for new Interim Release versions and will instead direct you to the devblog.peerblock.com
            site. Interim Releases are released much more frequently than Public Releases, so
            if you are on the Interim Release train and find that you're being prompted to download
            a new version too often you should consider installing a Public Release instead.
            (No need to uninstall in this case, simply install the Public Release on top of
            the Interim Release you currently have installed.)

        <a name="10" style="font-weight: bold">Something I need to access is blocked! What
        can I do?</a>
        <p>
            Sometimes the IP addresses programs need to connect to may end up on one of the
            blocklists you've configured PeerBlock to use. This can cause software to not download
            new updates, Windows Update to no longer work, programs to lose connectivity to
            the internet, etc. Luckily this is easy to fix!
        </p>
        <p>
            What you'll need to do first is to identify the IP address(es) to which your software
            needs to connect. For example, let's say you have a program that needs to connect
            to the Internet when it starts up, but that program is not working. Open the main
            PeerBlock window, and then start up your problematic program. In the PeerBlock window
            you should see some blocked IP addresses logged; right-click on these IP-addresses
            and select "Allow"! You can temporarily allow them for 15 minutes or 1 hour, or
            you can allow them permanently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your "Permanent Allow List" can be edited later by going into the List Manager,
            selecting the "Permanent Allows" list (lists\permallow.p2b), then clicking the "Open
            List" button.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a name="11" style="font-weight: bold">My icon's gone! How do I get it back?</a>
        <p>
            If you select the "Always hide tray icon" option in the Settings panel, the tray
            icon for PeerBlock will disappear. If you close the main PeerBlock window after
            this point, you will no longer see any way to reopen PeerBlock and view your logs,
            change your settings, or exit the program! To bring back the main window, just run
            a new instance of PeerBlock - this will bring back the main window, from where you
            can do whatever you need to do.

This file describes ways to interface external applications with PeerBlock.
It may provide documentation for creating plugins later on.


Hide/Unhide PeerBlock
-------------------------------
To bring PeerBlock out of the tray or send it back, you can do the following:

UINT msg=RegisterWindowMessage(_T("PeerBlockSetVisible"));
SendMessage(HWND_BROADCAST, msg, 0, TRUE); // TRUE to show, FALSE to hide.


Force PeerBlock to reload its lists:
-------------------------------
PeerBlock allows external list editors to force a list
reload and possibly cache regeneration.  This can be done like so:

UINT msg=RegisterWindowMessage(_T("PeerBlockLoadLists"));
SendMessage(HWND_BROADCAST, msg, 0, 0);
